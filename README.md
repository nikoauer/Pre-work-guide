# <Pre-work study guide>

## Description

The reason behind creating this study guide was to establish an introduction into HMTL, CSS, Git, Github and Javascript through the process of building a study guide for the course. In breaking down the building blocks to creating this site, we have a rudimentary understanding of how the languages, Git and Github interact with each other. Apart from udnerstanding how the site works and interacts it also introduced some basic debugging techniques such as console.log and learning to compartmentalize code in order to isolate possible issues. 

I have a had some previous experience with HTML and CSS, so I didn't learna  great deal in that department but I did learn in relation to using terminal, Git and Github better to streamline your uploading and downloading work flow. In relation to Javascript I have had no experience, so I did learn some new ideas arounds how the language is written however I have had previous experience learning the foundations of computer science through C, so it was interesting to already understand a great deal in terms of foundations despite using another language such as Javascript. Examples of this being already having used loops, conditionals and understanding variables and functions in C, much transitioned over to Javascript. 

One issue I constantly run into is writing quickly and incorrectly writing variable names. Thankfully it is easy to debug the issue when a error arrises and tells you what line was wrong but this was the only minor issue throughout the project. 

## Installation

In order to build set project, Github and a Github account is required. Access to terminal (if on mac) is required. VS Code is required, downloaded and installed. 

## Usage

Download the files of the repository to your computer. 

Now through your terminal locate the files of the repository through the CLI:
These commands may be helpful:
‘Pwd’ displays the current working directory
‘ls’ displays the list of files and folders in the current directory
‘Cd’ navigates through to the directory
‘Cd ..’ Navigates backwards one level through the directory
‘Mkdir’ creates a new directory
‘Touch’ creates a file inside the directory

Once the repository files are located you can either open this in VS code with: Code .
Right click on the index.html file and click on "open in live browser" in order to see the file in your browser

OR

If you wish to edit the code to add more features do so with such commands:
‘Git status’ to check what file/folder you are in
‘Git Checkout -b <name of new branch>’ Git checkout is used to switch branches, the -b lets git know it’s a new branch, then followed the name of the new branch.
Then edit your file in Visual Code Editor and then save it.
‘Git add -A’ We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.
‘Git commit -m <“message of what the change was”>’ in order to commit the code 
‘Git pull origin main’ to pull the up to date source code. If it pops up saying if the branch is up to date then your branch is up to date.
‘Git push origin <name of new branch>’ 
Then navigate to GitHub and check your pull requests, should be above your repository. Click on it and check to make sure it is connecting between the correct branches, then add title and description and then click pull request.


## Credits

I completed this task without collaborators. I was however assisted through the project through the USYD coding bootcamp, as well as these sites:

Git cheat sheet: <https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf>
Javascript documentation: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>
README. documentation: <https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide>


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

🏆 The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
